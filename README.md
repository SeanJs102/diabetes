To prepare the diabetes dataset for better understanding and to eliminate inconsistencies that would hamper the learning process of the different algorithms.

Using Supervised Learning to classify people based on their risk of diabetes using Logistic Regression as well as Decision Trees.

In order to analyze and compare the effectiveness of these classification methods in regard to the accuracy rate.

In order to make recommendations which classification technique would yield the best predictions about the risk of having diabetes.
